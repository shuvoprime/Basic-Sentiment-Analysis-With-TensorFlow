# Basic-Sentiment-Analysis
developed, trained, and tested a Neural Network model that could predict whether movie reviews were good or negative after training, therefore identifying the sentiment of the review text. This project was completed as part of a Coursera-led initiative.


The **IMDB reviews dataset** offered by keras is used in this model.

There are 50000 reviews in the dataset, with 25000 serving as training data and another 25000 serving as test data.

Use neural networks to solve text classification difficulties.
-----

Whether the review is positive or unfavorable is predicted by the trained model.

The trained model was accurate 86.7 percent of the time.
